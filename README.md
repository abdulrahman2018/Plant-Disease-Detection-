# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
Plant Disease Detection is a project aimed at automatically detecting diseases in plants using deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to assist farmers and agriculture professionals in early disease detection, leading to better crop management and higher yields.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of various plant diseases as well as healthy plants. You can find more information and download the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/abdulrahman2018/Plant-Disease-Detection-.git
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Preprocessing: Before training the model, preprocess the dataset [](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset/data).
2. Training: Train the deep learning model using the provided scripts or notebooks.
3. Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on test data to assess its performance.
4. Inference: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify images of plants into healthy or diseased categories. The model architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.

## Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting plant diseases.
